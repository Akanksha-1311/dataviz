### Course Overview

Welcome to our exciting journey into the world of Data Visualization! This course is designed to provide you with a solid understanding of visualization fundamentals, emphasizing practical skills and real-world applications through Python and Javascript.

Visualizing data is an essential skill for researchers, data scientists, analysts, journalists, and professionals in various fields dealing with information. It is an important tool for understanding complex datasets and making data-driven decisions. Also, it can play an important role in troubleshooting issues within complex data analysis pipelines or AI models. Furthermore, data visualization serves as a powerful medium for communicating data-driven insights and narratives with colleagues or broader audiences.

This course is heavily based on Prof. Yong-Yeol “YY” Ahn's Data Visualization course ([http://yongyeol.com/](http://yongyeol.com/)).

### Grading

Grades will not be curved and will use the following scale.

```
93.00 - 100%  = A
90.00 - 92.99% = A-
87.00 - 89.99% = B+
83.00 - 86.99% = B
80.00 - 82.99% = B-
77.00 - 79.99% = C+
73.00 - 76.99% = C
70.00 - 72.99% = C-
67.00 - 69.99% = D+
63.00 - 66.99% = D
60.00 - 62.99% = D-
<60.00       = F
```

You will be evaluated based on performance in engagement (participation or attendance), assignments, final project and the final exam. The final grade will be calculated as follows:

- 20% - Attendance/Engagement
- 20% - Assignments
- 30% - Final project
- 30% - Final exam

Some assignments may give bonus points for the final grade. Extra credits will be given based on engagement in class and online, such as asking questions, helping others, and contributing to the course materials.

#### Policy on the Use of Generative AI and LLMs

In accordance with [IU’s Generative AI Policies](https://teaching.iu.edu/resources/generative-ai/policies.html), you have the instructor **permission** to use generative AI (GAI) and large language models (LLMs), including GPT, Gemini, Llama, Copilot, and similar tools, in this course as long as you do so responsibly and transparently. This includes tasks such as code completion, brainstorming, or improving the clarity of your text. However, these tools are **not recommended for fully automating** assignments or drafting entire project reports. Keep in mind that the quality of GAI output can be unreliable, and you remain fully accountable for any inaccuracies, biases, or offensive content you submit.

- **Disclosure**: If GAI usage played a substantial role in shaping your work, you must clearly acknowledge it. Provide a brief description of how you used the tool, and if it was essential to your final result, include a copy of the prompt(s).
- **Citation Example** (no particular format required beyond basic transparency):

  > OpenAI. (2024). *ChatGPT (Mar 14 version)* [Large language model]. [https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat)

- **Verification**: For code generated by AI, make sure it does exactly what you intend. You must be able to explain its logic and functionality; “blindly trusting” AI outputs is strongly discouraged.
- **Limitations**: No GAI tools may be used during exams or project presentations. Doing so will be considered a violation of course policies.
- **Integrity**: Use of GAI without proper acknowledgment can be treated as plagiarism or cheating.

> **Note**: There is currently no IU-approved or otherwise reliable method to detect AI-generated content. Some GAI systems can produce excessively verbose or uniquely structured text, but this is not consistent or guaranteed. We rely on your honesty and accurate self-reporting regarding the use of these tools.

In short, while GAI can streamline your workflow, it is **not** a substitute for human critical thinking. Leverage these tools thoughtfully, verify their outputs, and be prepared to justify your methods.


## Setting Up Your Data Visualization Environment

We suggest using miniconda to install python packages and setup your environment. You can also use Anaconda, but it is a larger package and may take longer to install. Alternatively, you can also setup your own python environment using pip and virtualenv.

### Step 1: Install Miniconda

Miniconda is a minimal installer for Conda, a package manager and an environment manager. Here’s how to install it:

1. **Download Miniconda**:
   - Visit the [Miniconda download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
   - Choose the version suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Download the appropriate installer (Python 3.x is recommended).

2. **Install Miniconda**:
   - **Windows**: Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Open a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the downloaded file, and run `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh` (adjust the filename as needed).

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open a new terminal window.
   - Type `conda list`. If Miniconda is installed correctly, you'll see a list of installed packages.

### Step 2: Create a Conda Environment

Creating a separate environment for your Data Science projects is good practice:

1. **Create a New Environment for this course**:
    - Run the command: `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create a new environment called datascience with all the necessary packages installed.

2. **Activate the Environment**:
   - Run: `conda activate datascience`.

3. **Launch Jupyter Lab**:
   - Run: `jupyter lab`.
   - This will open Jupyter Lab in your default web browser.

### Step 3: Manually Install Essential Packages

The created environment already includes most of the packages we'll need, but if you need to install any additional packages, here's how:

1. **Manually Install Packages **:
   - In your activated environment, run: `conda install <name of the package>` to install the packages
   - For example, to install the `scikit-learn` package, run: `conda install scikit-learn`.
   - Alternatively, you can use `pip install <name of the package>` to install packages from PyPI.

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Make sure everything is installed correctly:

1. **Open a New Notebook in Jupyter Lab**:
   - In Jupyter Lab, create a new notebook.

2. **Test the Packages**:
   - Try importing the packages: `import numpy as np`, `import pandas as pd`, `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`.
   - If there are no errors, the packages are installed correctly.

### Additional Tips

- **Updating Conda**: Keep Conda and your packages updated with `conda update conda` and `conda update --all`.
- **Managing Environments**: View your environments with `conda env list` and switch between them using `conda activate <env_name>`.
- **Finding Packages**: To find available packages, use `conda search <package_name>`.
- **Conda Cheat Sheet**: For more commands, see the [Conda Cheat Sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html).

You must have established your eligibility for support services through Disability Services for Students. Note that services are confidential, may take time to put into place, and are not retroactive. Captions and alternate media for print materials may take three or more weeks to get produced. Please contact Disability Services for Students at [http://disabilityservices.indiana.edu](http://disabilityservices.indiana.edu) or 812-855-7578 as soon as possible if accommodations are needed. The office is located on the third floor, west tower, of the Wells Library (Room W302). Walk-ins are welcome 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. You can also locate a variety of campus resources for students and visitors who need assistance at [http://www.iu.edu/~ada/index.shtml](http://www.iu.edu/~ada/index.shtml).

4. **Bias-based incidents.** Any act of discrimination or harassment based on race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability can be reported to biasincident@indiana.edu or to the Dean of Students Office at (812) 855-8188.

5. **Sexual misconduct and Title IX.** Title IX and IU’s Sexual Misconduct Policy prohibit sexual misconduct in any form, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, and dating and domestic violence. If you have experienced sexual misconduct, or know someone who has, you can use university resources:
   - a) The Sexual Assault Crisis Services (SACS) at (812) 855-8900 (counseling services)
   - b) Confidential Victim Advocates (CVA) at (812) 856-2469 (advocacy and advice services)
   - c) IU Health Center at (812) 855-4011 (health and medical services)

It is also important that you know that Title IX and University policy require me to share any information brought to my attention about potential sexual misconduct, with the campus Deputy Title IX Coordinator or IU’s Title IX Coordinator. In that event, those individuals will work to ensure that appropriate measures are taken and resources are made available. Protecting student privacy is of utmost concern, and information will only be shared with those that need to know to ensure the University can respond and assist.

6. **If you have any mental health issues,** don’t hesitate to contact IU’s Counseling and Psychological Services, which provides free counseling sessions. Also, please contact Disability Services for Students at [http://disabilityservices.indiana.edu](http://disabilityservices.indiana.edu) or 812-855-7578 as soon as possible if accommodations are needed.


### Policy on the Use of Generative AI and LLMs

In accordance with [IU’s Generative AI Policies](https://teaching.iu.edu/resources/generative-ai/policies.html), you have the instructor **permission** to use generative AI (GAI) and large language models (LLMs), including GPT, Gemini, Llama, Copilot, and similar tools, in this course as long as you do so responsibly and transparently. This includes tasks such as code completion, brainstorming, or improving the clarity of your text. However, these tools are **not recommended** for fully automating assignments or drafting entire project reports. Keep in mind that the quality of GAI output can be unreliable, and you remain fully accountable for any inaccuracies, biases, or offensive content you submit.

- **Disclosure**: If GAI usage played a substantial role in shaping your work, you must clearly acknowledge it. Provide a brief description of how you used the tool, and if it was essential to your final result, include a copy of the prompt(s).  
- **Citation Example** (no particular format required beyond basic transparency):  
  > OpenAI. (2024). *ChatGPT (Mar 14 version)* [Large language model]. [https://chat.openai.com/chat](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
- **Verification**: For code generated by AI, make sure it does exactly what you intend. You must be able to explain its logic and functionality; “blindly trusting” AI outputs is strongly discouraged.  
- **Limitations**: No GAI tools may be used during exams or project presentations. Doing so will be considered a violation of course policies.  
- **Integrity**: Use of GAI without proper acknowledgment can be treated as plagiarism or cheating.

> **Note**: There is currently no IU-approved or otherwise reliable method to detect AI-generated content. Some GAI systems can produce excessively verbose or uniquely structured text, but this is not consistent or guaranteed. We rely on your honesty and accurate self-reporting regarding the use of these tools.

In short, while GAI can streamline your workflow, it is **not** a substitute for human critical thinking. Leverage these tools thoughtfully, verify their outputs, and be prepared to justify your methods.
